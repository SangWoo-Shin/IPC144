1.  After finishing the workshop week 5, I stongly felt the advantages of using user-defined types (structures).
    In this workshop, I had to store variety of information about the game and the player. If I did not use
    the structures, as the game process progressed, I needed to control all the variables one by one which are 
    related to the game and player information. But, by using the structures in this workshop, I can group the
    variables related to the player and variables rlated to the game into one structure each. As a result, if the player
    chooses to act on his turn, I can handle all the changes in variables caused by the action at once, and also I was
    able to reflect all the changes in variables about game information at once after the player's turn.
2.  At first, to store the history of games, "Game_History" structure wiil be declared which includes "Player_Info" structure
    and "Game_Info" structure. Secondly, in order to continuoulsy store game results, "Player_Info" structure and 
    "Game_Info" structure will be replace with an array format like Player_Info[the number of games] and
     Game_Info[the number of games].
3. During the workshop, It was the most difficult to apprehend the flow of changed value through the iteration loop.
   Thus, to overcome this problem, when I deal with the complicated iteration loop, I drew a brief structure of the loop
   on the paper and recorded all the changed values in the loop. Moreover, it was really hard for me to output the value
   according to the conditions. Before starting the workshop week 5, I have only used 'if' and 'flag' but I have rarely used
   'else if'. However, to finish this workshop, I had to use a more effective conditional sentence, so I studied more about
   'esle if'. As a result, I could finish this workshop more easily and my understanding of 'else if' improved.
