1. In order to map the month integer value to the first three characters, there are two method to accomplish it.
   First of one is using 'if'. For example, after getting month integer number through the 'scanf', if the integer
   value is 1, then print out 'JAN' using 'if'. Second of one is using 'switch'. For example, after receiving month integer
   value through the 'scanf', you can receive the integer value with 'switch' and print out the characters in the case
   corresponding to the integer value. Additionally, if you want to print out the next character value, you can put each
   function into the iteration tools like 'while', 'do~while' or 'for' and run it. whether using 'if' or 'switch'.
2. There are 3 types of iteration constructs. First of one is 'while' and second one is 'do~while' and last one is 'for'. When I 
   find some errors during making iteration program, then I usually use 'break point' function. Because majority of errors from
   iteration are occured by typing wrong value into the program so ,by using 'break point', I can easily find wrong value
   which happens error.
3. Before debugging the program, I usually use 'build' function, Through the 'build' I can find errors or warnings in advance.
   So if there are no errors in my program then I press the 'Debug' button. However, if there are errors or warnings in my 
   program, then I check the errors or warnings through the error list which is located under the code and, after checking the
   location of error, I use 'break point' to confirm the value causing the error.
