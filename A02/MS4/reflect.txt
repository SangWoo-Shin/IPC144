2.   Firstly, every time I do an assignment, I do it through various trials and errors to print out the output required by the assignment,
   and the process of finding the correct answer is very painful and hard, but the joy I feel when I finally find the answer is indescribable.
   In particular, the number of new functions required in this assinment was small, ulike other assignments, but in order to receive
   each value from a file and print them out, I had to use 'fscanf' to get them in the appropriate format, and it took a very long time
   to find the right format. So, as it took a lot of time, the joy of finding the right answer was great.
     Secondly, after finish assignment2 milestone 4, I looked back on the tasks I have been deen doing. When I saw that I created a
   brief application related to a bank account, I felt a lot. It was so good that I made the program with such a long code, which I
   did not even know the basics of the C language at the beginning of the first semester and I feel like I am taking a step closer to
   becoming a programmer and it was nice to feel a sense of accomplishment.

3.   The hardest and worst thing about this assignment was the trial and error mentioned earlier. Of course, it was good to feel the joy
   of finding the right answer through all those trials and errors, but it was very difficult to repeat the same work or use breakpoints
   to find where the errors occurred one by one to reach that stage. In particular, in this task, values had to be input or output using
   variables contained by structure in the structure, so if an error occurred somewhere, it took quite a long time to find the location
   where the error occurred.
      Second, this was my mistake, but when I built in the visual studio, there was no error, so I was relieved, but when I compiled on Linux,
   I saw numerous errors. At first, I was embarrassed because the errors in Linux compilation were full of strange words. For example, Linux
   decribe the error like "the expected value is A but your answer is A". So I had a hard time finding this unknown errors and it was annoyed.
   But, as a result, it was an error that occurred because I did not logically fit the order of declaration, and through this, I could know the
   importance of the order of declaration.
