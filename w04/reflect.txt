1. At first, I declared the appropriate arrays for each data type. For example, if I need arrays which can
   store Character value, then I declared 'char array[number]' on my code. Moreover, I set all the size of arrays
   to 10. Because, all the arrays include the information about each item and the maximum number of items is
   10 in this workshop. However, when I operated the program, I had to select the nubmber of items.
   So, to reduce the declaration of variables, I used the number of items as the scope of the 'for' loop and, by using
   the integer value 'i' in 'for' loop, I saved the information in each array step-by-step by connecting each element
   to 'i'. I think it was a key point in this workshop.
2. For example, when I declare the array whose size is 3 like 'array[3]', this array save the information from array[0]
   to array[2]. And ,in this workshop, I had to save information to array step-by-step so I used the 'for' loop and,
   in this 'for' loop, I used the iterator variable 'i' which start from zero instead of one because every arrays start
   from zero index. Thus I iterated arrays initialzing the iterator variable to zero because, it can make codes simpler
   than initializing the iterator variable to one.
3. First of all, array can save a lot of infomation and when we use the array, we type the array in the order of 'data type',
   'arrangement name' and 'arrangement size'. The 'data type' is tell you what elements of characteristics an array stores
    and  'arrangement name' is literally a name of arrangement. Lastly 'arrangement size' is tell you how much information
    an array stores and it is expressed in numbers in square brackets. Thus, if I want to declare an array whose 'data type',
   'arrangement name' and 'arrangement size' are 'int', 'ABC' and '5' respectively, then I type 'int ABC[5]' on my code.
    Moreover, in this array, it can save five pieces of information from ABC[0] to ABC[4]. The first element of array always
    start from zero index instead of one. If we want to save information in the elements in array step-by-step, using 'for' loop is an
    efficient method. The 'for' loop allows you repeat the same action as many times as you want and you can set the 
    number of times as the size of array and store information in each element of array.
