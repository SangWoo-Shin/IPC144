1. While doing the IPC144 task, I have solved the problem by fixing very small things one by one to
   get the perfect output every moment. Especially, when I send my workshop code or assignment code
   through the matrix, I have to check if there is a wrong spelling word in my result or if the line spacing
   is different from the original. Moreover, in this assignment, I declared the function prototypes faster than
   the structures, it was an little error, but in the Visual Studio Code there were no errors. However, when I compiled
   my assignment through the gcc, there are lots of errors with weird expression. As a result, I took about 14 hours
   to find my errors in code and I could not submit my assignment on time. However, I do not blame this way of
   submitting assignments. This is because I think the ability to produce results that exactly match 
   the results required by someone in a short time is one of the most important abilities for programmers.
   As a result, in the past, when I made the code, I just had to make the result I wanted, regardless of 
   how the format came out, but now I have to submit the formatted code as an assignment at a fixed time,
   so I needed to speed up my hands and now I can use a lot of shortcuts. As several shortcut keys became available,
   I felt that the difference between being able to use shortcut keys was much greater than I thought. Moreover
   by using the shortcut, I could protect my wrist. Because, in the past, when I did not use any shortcut keys, If I wants
   to modify some codes in my program, then I always have to select those codes through the mouse or track pad on 
   my laptop. In conclusion, accuracy and quickness are very important abilities for a programmer, so the moment I modify
   my code little by little while doing the task seems to be a good training to be a good programmer.

2. From this workshop 6 to the current Assignment 1, I declared a header file and created a source file which is definition for
   the functions of header file to complete the task. The more complicated the problem and the more required functions I had 
   to use in the program. But if I type all the function in the main function,  it was difficult to read and understand after making
   the program and if I had something to modify, it took a lot of time to find a part to fix. For these reasons, I realised that declaring
   multiple functions in a header file first and defining these functions in a source file of the same name as the header file can make
   the program more efficient and easier to understand. Of course, I can declare all the definition of functions in a header file,
   but the reason why I only declared the name of function and type the its definition in the source file is because I can quickly
   figure out which functions are organized in that header file and quickly access the contents of the function in source file after 
   reading the name of function in header file. However, as the problem became more complicated, it became difficult to explain
   the entire function with a single header file, so various header files were needed in this Agreement 1. In this situation,
   the header file could not be named roughly. This is because, as multiple header files are created, functions in the header file
   can be easily found later only when there are distinct names between them. For example, in the assignment 1, it require me to name
   headerfiles that are easy to distinguish. Thus there are three headerfiles which are commonHelpers.h, account.h and accountTicketingUI.h.
   Thanks to these clear names during the task, I was able to access locations that needed to be modified faster than when modifying code.

3. In this task, I had to first log in to my account and then I had to make a decision to create, modify, or delete an account in it, and after 
   making a decision, it requires me to make various new choices depending on the option that I selected before. In this way,
   this task has a cascade menu system, for example, if I want to get rid of one of my accounts, I can log in to my account first
   and select number 3 "Remove an account" from the agent menu and then I can erase the account by typing the number of acount
   that I want to erase. As another example, if I want to change the contents of one of my accounts, first enter the account number
   in the "Account ticketing system" to log in, and access the agent menu. Then, select number 2 "modify an existing account"
   and enter the number of the account I want to change. After that, I could find new options to change my account type, personal information,
   or login information, and I can select what I want to change and modify the information. As shown in the example above, the cascaded system
   shows various tasks to the user, and as the user selects, it gradually narrows down to the desired task. If the program is organized, the user
   can easily and quickly access the tasks that users want by dividing them into parts. Another advantage is that building a system in a cascaded
   system frameworks can also increase security by using the characteristics of this structure. In this task, the user must enter the correct account number
   in the login menu without initially exposing all options to the user to access the account. However, if the program is organized in a way
   that shows all the menus at once without being cascaded, it would not be possible to authenticate the users through the personal passwords or
   account numbers to access the information.
