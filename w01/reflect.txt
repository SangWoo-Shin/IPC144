Through the workshop, I could learn '<stdio.h>' which is header file in C-language program has a lot of power functions
and I learned 'printf' from those functions. SSH is a command to log in to a remote host and, in the procedure of transfering file to others
,it require password to users, so I could safely send my assignment to professor through the Putty. Moreover, SFTP is a 'secure file transfer protocol'
and it can send and receive files through the SSH protocol and, to send my assignments, I used WinSCP to use sftp.
