1.   In "ReportData" structure, it consists of three int-type variables and six double-type variables.
   The memory size of int-type and double-type are 4bytes and 8byte respectively. Thus the total
   memory size of "ReportData" structure is 60bytes because it is (4bytesX3) + (8bytesX6) = 60bytes.
     In order to improve the passing of this information to functions, The pointer was used to store
   the values required for each member in the structure, declare the structure in an array form in the start function,
   and put the "displayReportData" function in a for-loop to print the result value corresponding to each index.
   As a result, There was no need to declare a new structure whenever each new item was entered.

2.   Since several members in ReportData sturcture contain common members with CatFoodInfo structure,
    so, to save the amount of memory of the arguments transferred to the function, CatFoodInfo structure
    should be decalred in the ReportData structure. As a result, it does not need to declare addtional
    common variables in ReportData structure and memory could be saved as much as the amount 
    of memory of common variables. 
     After modification of the variable declaration, in the "displayReportData" function, The shape of 
   the variable to be printed should also be modified. For example, the variables sku and price which
   are the common members in ReportData sturcture and CatFoodInfo structure need to be changed
   from reportData.sku, reportData.price to reportData.catFoodInfo.sku, reportData.catFoodInfo.sku respectively.
